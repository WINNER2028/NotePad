# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To install Tailwind CSS for the NotePad project, steps followed:

1. Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

2. Create a Tailwind configuration file. You can generate one by running the following command:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

This command will create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project's root directory.

3. Create a CSS file where you'll include Tailwind's styles. For example, you can create a `styles/tailwind.css` file:

```css
/* styles/tailwind.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

4. Import the Tailwind CSS file into your project's entry file (usually `index.css` or `App.css`). Make sure to include any other global stylesheets you may have.

```css
/* src/index.css */
@import './styles/tailwind.css';

/* Your other global styles here */
```

5. Ensure that your build tool is configured to process CSS files using PostCSS. If you're using Vite, this is typically handled out of the box.

That's it! Now Tailwind CSS is installed and ready to use in the NotePad project. You can start using Tailwind's utility classes in your React components or HTML templates....
